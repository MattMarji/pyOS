# pyOS
This is an implementation of a scheduler that has the ability to run and handle tasks concurrently with no need for locking mechanisms.

The implementation relies HEAVILY on coroutines.

I recommend if you are not familiar with coroutines to read more on them here: www.dabeaz.com/coroutines/Coroutines.pdf

The inspiration for this scheduler was to further understand coroutines and generators which are a concept not found in typically programming langauges (C,Java...)
